<h1 id="1">How Do I Know if I'm in Menopause?</h1>
<p>A couple of years ago, the north american menopause society discovered a link between chronic fatigue syndrome and early menopause. Their results show that women with cfs were 12 times more likely to experience pelvic pain, 16% more likely to have missed or stopped periods and more than twice as likely to use hormones to treat irregular periods, menopausal symptoms or bone loss. <img style="max-width: 60%; margin: 3px;" src="https://www.menopausenow.com/pics/8/9/d/557484/menopause-now-img1.png" alt="menopause symptoms" align="right" /> Perhaps most worrying though, was the fact that 62% of women with cfs were likely to have experienced early menopause as the result of a hysterectomy, compared with 33% of women without cfs.</p>

<p>Menopause happens when you haven't had a period for 12 straight months and you aren't pregnant or sick. It's a normal part of aging. It happens because female sex hormone levels naturally go down as you get older. Your ovaries eventually stop releasing eggs, so you'll no longer have periods or be able to get pregnant.</p>

<p>During postmenopause, your hormone levels will not fluctuate to the same extent that they do during the lead-up to menopause, which means that many postmenopausal women find relief from some menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes. After going through years of decline, your levels of oestrogen and progesterone will remain at a low level throughout postmenopause, which introduces new health needs for your body as it gets older. For instance, low levels of oestrogen put postmenopausal women at an increased risk of osteoporosis, and heart disease. With attention to diet and lifestyle however, these risks can be managed, keeping you happy and healthy as you age.</p>
<p>You might be surprised to hear just how many symptoms of the menopause there are - doctors have identified 34 signs, based on research into the most common and recognisable symptoms. Not every woman will experience these changes - and there may be ones that are unique to individuals. The fact there are so many side-effect to this natural process may feel a bit daunting. It's worth remembering, there is effective treatment available for the menopause , so there is no need to suffer in silence.</p>
<p>Sometimes nothing. And it would be great if that was always the case. Some women sail through their menopause with barely a symptom, but it&rsquo;s not an easy transition for all. By talking about it openly, raising awareness and putting the right support in place, perhaps we could get to a point where menopause is no longer an issue in the workplace at all.</p>

<p>Around one in 100 women experience menopause before the age of 40, and this is known as premature ovarian insufficiency or premature menopause. Many celebrities have spoken out about their own experiences, such as zoe ball , who said she was "menopausal and hot and hairy".</p>
<p>Women may have different signs or symptoms at menopause. That&rsquo;s because estrogen is used by many parts of your body. As you have less estrogen, you could have various symptoms. Many women experience very mild symptoms that are easily treated by lifestyle changes, like avoiding caffeine or carrying a portable fan to use when a hot flash strikes. Some women don&rsquo;t require any treatment at all. Other symptoms can be more problematic.</p>
<p>The first signs &amp; symptoms of menopause - youtube.</p>
<p>Most women first begin developing menopause symptoms about four years before their last period. Symptoms often continue until about four years after a woman&rsquo;s last period. A small number of women experience menopause symptoms for up to a decade before menopause actually occurs, and 1 in 10 women experience menopausal symptoms for 12 years following their last period.</p>
<p>And here we are&mdash;natural menopause, the spontaneous, permanent ending of menstruation that is not caused by any medical treatment. Menopause is a normal, natural event. It&rsquo;s defined as the final menstrual period and is confirmed when a woman has not had her period for 12 consecutive months. Women in north america will likely experience natural menopause between ages 40 and 58, averaging around age 51. Some women, however, reach this phase in their 30s, others in their 60s. Typically, women reach menopause around the same age as their mothers and sisters.</p>
<p>The menopause is the name given to the end of menstruation (periods). It is also commonly referred to as &ldquo;the change of life&rdquo;. In the uk, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. If the menopause occurs in a woman who is under 45 years of age it is known as premature menopause. It is estimated that premature menopause affects 1% of women under the age of 40 and 0. 1% of women under the age of 30.</p>
<h2 id="2">10 Tips to Deal With Menopause Symptoms</h2>

<p>Yes, menopause can affect your sex drive &mdash; but it doesn&rsquo;t mean your sex life is over. Dealing with the physical and emotional symptoms of menopause can make you feel less sexual desire. The symptoms can also affect your sleep and lower your energy &mdash; which might make you not so into sex. Vaginal dryness and decreased sensation can also feel like a turn-off. It&rsquo;s also normal to feel a range of emotions, including anxiety, sadness, or loss while going through menopause.</p>
<p>Here are tips for tackling some of the unwanted symptoms of the menopause &ndash; although it may be wise to see your gp if you feel that things are becoming difficult to manage. 1. Maintain a healthy lifestyle as oestrogen levels drop, the menopause brings an increased risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. Sticking to a healthy diet that&rsquo;s low in saturated fat and salt can help keep your blood pressure low. Calcium-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables , low-fat yogurt and milk&nbsp;- vitamin d from oily fish and eggs or supplements can help to keep bones strong.</p>
<p>The menopause is a natural part of the ageing process when a woman's oestrogen levels start to decline. But when does it happen, what are the signs and what can you do to ease the symptoms? the menopause can be a worrying and stressful time but knowledge is power &ndash; and the more you know, the better you can deal with it. Dr stephanie goodwin , menopause specialist gp at chiswick medical centre, explains:.</p>

<h3 id="3">7 Signs You're in Perimenopause</h3>
<p>What are the signs of perimenopause? you're in your 40s, you wake up in a sweat at night, and your periods are erratic and often accompanied by heavy bleeding: chances are, you're going through perimenopause. Many women experience an array of symptoms as their hormones shift during the months or years leading up to menopause &mdash; that is, the natural end of menstruation. <img style="max-width: 60%; margin: 6px;" src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/08/10/istock-661959544.jpg" alt="women" align="right" /> Menopause is a point in time, but perimenopause (peri, greek for "around" or "near" + menopause) is an extended transitional state. It's also sometimes referred to as the menopausal transition, although technically, the transition ends 12 months earlier than perimenopause (see "stages of reproductive aging" below).</p>
<p>Irregular periods are among the earlier symptoms of perimenopause in most women. As your egg production decreases, your hormone levels drop too. At times, you may get signs of premenstrual syndrome such as irritability, bloating, and breast tenderness but fail to get your periods.</p>
<p>Period changes are usually the first signs of menopause. For example, your period may start to happen every six to eight weeks. Or you may miss a couple months before it comes back again. You may also have a heavier flow or a lighter flow from time to time. That said, it&rsquo;s important to know you can still get pregnant during perimenopause. So, continue to use birth control in the lead up to menopause as you normally would. Also, if you&rsquo;ve missed your period and you&rsquo;re not sure whether perimenopause has started, consider taking a pregnancy test as a first step.</p>
<p>When it comes to spotting the signs of menopause, you may be expecting hot flushes , irregular periods and the prospect of feeling weepy at news reports and cat food adverts. But during the perimenopause &ndash; the years running up to menopause, when your ovaries completely stop releasing eggs &ndash; there are some other signs to look out for.</p>
<h2 id="4">Hot Flashes: Symptoms and Treatment</h2>
<p>This treatment helps balance the body&rsquo;s hormone levels by providing supplemental estrogen and a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone. Hormone therapy comes in various forms, including skin patches and topical creams. It can help reduce the occurrence of hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. However, using it may increase the risk of developing certain diseases and health conditions. <img style="max-width: 20%; margin: 3px;" src="https://i1.wp.com/megsmenopause.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-16-at-12.10.45.png?fit\u003d1112,854\u0026quality\u003d95\u0026ssl\u003d1" alt="symptoms" align="left" /></p>
<p>Menopause is a time at which a woman's reproductive capacity ends. It is defined as the absence of menstrual periods for a period of 12 consecutive months. Prior to the actual menopause , a woman may experience irregular periods and irregular episodes of vaginal bleeding. After menopause , symptoms can occur due to lowering of estrogen levels in the body. Not every woman will experience all the symptoms of menopause, and symptoms vary among women. It is also possible for symptoms of lowered estrogen to begin years before the actual menopause. Some of the most commonly reported symptoms include hot flashes and night sweats. These can be associated with flushing and may be followed by.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t any evidence that complementary therapies such as aromatherapy, acupuncture and reflexology, can improve menopausal symptoms. Some women, however, choose to take herbal remedies, such as black cohosh, soya-based foods and red clover for hot flushes. Remember &ndash; like medicines, herbal remedies can have side-effects and can interact with other drugs. Ask your pharmacist for advice if you plan to try any herbal treatment.</p>
<p>You may be transitioning into menopause if you begin experiencing some or all of the following symptoms: hot flashes (a sudden feeling of warmth that spreads over the body). Night sweats and/or cold flashes. Vaginal dryness ; discomfort during sex. Urinary urgency (a pressing need to urinate more frequently). Difficulty sleeping (insomnia). Emotional changes (irritability, mood swings, mild depression).</p>
<p>The diagnosis is clinical, based on the absence of menses for 12 months, and does not require further testing for appropriately presenting patients. Oestrogen therapy is an effective treatment for the management of menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, night sweats, and urogenital symptoms. For women with an intact uterus, a progestin must be co-administered with an oestrogen to protect against endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.</p>
<p>The menopause is caused by changes in hormone levels which take place as a woman gets older. Menopausal symptoms include hot flushes, mood changes, memory problems and changes in sex drive. The length of time that symptoms last for varies between individuals, but averages about 4 years. Treatment is available to help with symptoms if you want it.</p>
<p>Not every woman chooses hrt for menopausal symptoms. This may be because of your own or family history, or because you have concerns about the safety or side effects of hrt. Treatment options available without prescription are discussed in this section. Herbal medicines plants or plant extracts, such as st john&rsquo;s wort, black cohosh and isoflavones (soya products), can help reduce hot flushes and night sweats for some women. However, their safety is unknown and they can react with other medicines that you may be taking for conditions such as breast cancer, epilepsy, heart disease or asthma. You should check with your healthcare professional before taking any herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Hormone replacement therapy (hrt) is the most effective and widely used treatment for menopausal symptoms. As its name suggests, it is simply a way of replacing the hormone oestrogen that is lost during the menopause. Hrt aims to relieve those symptoms related to oestrogen deficiency &ndash; such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, and osteoporosis. The benefits of hrt as a remedy for hot flushes, sleep disturbances, vaginal symptoms and some mood disorders have been proved. On the other hand, some women experience unwanted side effects when taking hrt for the first time, such as breast tenderness, leg cramps, nausea, bloating, irritability and depression. Usually these symptoms resolve after a few months, but change in type, dose (oral: tablet; transdermal: patch or gel) or route of hrt may be required.</p>
<p>The main sign of the menopause starting is often noticed, as a change in menstrual period patterns, which can last up to four years but in some women, can be much longer. Around 80% of women suffer from some additional menopausal symptoms, though some women have few symptoms apart from the ending of menstruation. The most common menopausal symptoms are hot flushes (termed hot flashes in the us) and night sweats. These happen most commonly within the first year after the last period, although they can occur earlier. If severe, these can cause weakness and loss of energy, particularly night sweats, which may disturb normal sleeping patterns. Their severity tends to decrease with time.</p>
<p>Hrt is a highly effective treatment option, which involves replacing the oestrogen and progesterone hormones, which are significantly reduced during the menopause. Hrt is particularly useful in alleviating several symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes, vaginal dryness, utis and incontinence. It can also help in preventing osteoporosis&nbsp;since oestrogen plays an important role in promoting healthy bone growth.</p>
<p>Hot flashes are the most well-known symptoms of menopause, affecting approximately 50 percent of menopausal women. Hot flashes are a sudden sensation of feverish heat that can spread through the body, creating a flushing, or redness, particularly on the face.</p>
<p>Menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats and vaginal dryness as well as a decreased sex drive can affect new and existing relationships and&nbsp;your sex life. It may feel difficult or embarrassing talking about these problems, but it can help to discuss it with your treatment team or gp as they may be able to help.</p>
<p>Every woman&rsquo;s experience with menopause is unique; she may have all or just a few of these symptoms in varying levels of intensity. The main symptoms are hot flashes and night sweats. These are a sudden feeling of heat coming from inside, causing a red face and upper torso, a rapid heartbeat, and copious sweating. When experiencing this at night, the woman may become so drenched that she has to change bedclothes. Afterward, she may feel chilled. Researchers hypothesize that hot flashes are caused by changes to the hypothalamus, which regulates temperature.</p>
<p>Symptoms of perimenopause vary widely from one woman to another. Common symptoms include: cold hands and feet difficulty concentrating emotional or psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, nervousness or irritability which may be related to changing of hormones or to the stress of aging and changing roles headache hot flashes or flushes and sweating affect 75% of women. The flash may last from 30 seconds to five minutes and may be followed by chills.</p>
<p>Menopause has not been shown to affect memory or thinking. However, some women do report that they feel their memory or concentration has been affected by menopause. Sleep disturbance from night sweats can affect memory and concentration in the day. These symptoms generally improve when the hot flushes have settled down; either naturally or as a result of treatment.</p>
<h3 id="5">Menopause and Your Sex Drive</h3>
<p>Changes in hormones during the menopause not only affects the regularity of the menstrual cycle. They can also cause breast pain or tenderness. <img style="max-width: 70%; margin: 3px;" src="https://cdn1.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/21/15/menopause-symptoms-set-vector-21612115.jpg" alt="hot" align="right" /> This arises because the female hormones get thrown out of balance and is usually seen at around the time of ovulation or menstruation. In addition, lower oestrogen levels, together with a decrease in testosterone during this time of life, can lead to a reduction in libido or sexual drive. This may be made worse as a result of vaginal dryness which arises because of a reduction in oestrogen, blood flow and lubrication.</p>
<p>Reduced sex drive or a loss of libido is common during and after the menopause affecting 20-40% of women. &ldquo;it can be one of the most difficult symptoms to manage. This is often because the woman doesn&rsquo;t understand why it&rsquo;s is happening and what to do about it,&rdquo; says trudy hannington, a psychosexual therapist at the leger clinic.</p>
<p>While a man&rsquo;s sex drive is largely controlled by testosterone, a woman&rsquo;s is primarily controlled by oestrogen. As we&rsquo;ve already established, these levels drastically drop during menopause, which can reduce your sexual appetite.</p>
<p>It's common for women to lose interest in sex around the time of the menopause, but hrt can often help with this. If hrt isn't effective, you might be offered a testosterone supplement. Testosterone is the male sex hormone, but it can help to restore sex drive in menopausal women. It&rsquo;s not currently licensed for use in women, although it can be prescribed by a doctor if they think it might help.</p>
<p>Since menopause is due to the depletion of ovarian follicles/oocytes and severely reduced functioning of the ovaries, it is associated with lower levels of reproductive hormones, especially estrogen. Low estrogen can result in vasomotor instability (such as hot flushes and night sweats), psychological changes (such as mood swings, depression, and difficulty concentrating), insomnia, genital tract atrophy (such as vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, and urinary incontinence), skin changes (such as thinning and decreased elasticity). Lower androgen levels (male hormones) can contribute to the loss of sex drive. Any abnormal vaginal bleeding should be reported immediately to your doctor, since this may represent a precancerous or cancerous condition of the uterus or endometrial lining.</p>

<p>When a woman permanently stops having menstrual periods, she has reached the stage of life called menopause. Often called the change of life, this stage signals the end of a woman's ability to have children. Many healthcare providers actually use the term menopause to refer to the period of time when a woman's hormone levels start to change. Menopause is said to be complete when menstrual periods have ceased for one continuous year.</p>
<p>Get the right balance of your macros &ndash; protein, fats and carbs. The menopause is no time for radical exclusion diets because your body needs these supportive nutrients more than ever during this time of hormonal havoc. The best way to do this is to eat a combination of fibre-rich complex carbohydrate and protein with every meal and snack. Good sources of protein include meat, fish, eggs, cottage cheese, lentils, chickpeas, beans, soya, quinoa, nuts and seeds, and you&rsquo;ll find fibre in vegetables, wholegrains, such as oats, brown rice or wholemeal bread and fruit. Add a tablespoon of seeds to your morning cereal or porridge to add a protein and fibre boost to breakfast or opt for an egg on wholemeal toast.</p>
<p>Most women will&nbsp;experience some symptoms around the menopause. The duration and&nbsp;severity of these&nbsp;symptoms varies from woman to woman. Symptoms&nbsp;usually start&nbsp;a few months or years before&nbsp;your periods stop, known as&nbsp;the perimenopause, and&nbsp;can persist for some time afterwards. On average, most symptoms last around 4 years from your last period. However, around 1 in every 10 women experience them for up to 12 years.</p>
<p>There are certain things that may cause an early menopause - for example: if you have surgery to remove your ovaries for some reason, you are likely to develop menopausal symptoms straightaway. If you have radiotherapy to your pelvic area as a treatment for cancer. Some chemotherapy medicines that treat cancer may lead to an early menopause.</p>

<p>The average age of menopause in the uk is 511. The menopause is a normal life event for women, not an illness or medical condition. As the life expectancy of women has increased over the past century many women, on average, spend one-third of their lives being postmenopausal. The most common menopausal problems are vasomotor symptoms (i. E. Hot flushes and night sweats). Other symptoms include mood changes, memory loss, vaginal dryness and soreness, reduced libido, sleep disturbances, joint pains and muscle stiffness. These symptoms can be non-existent, last for a few years, or even decades. Around 75% of menopausal women experience symptoms, with one third of these describing them as severe.</p>
<p>Menopause, also known as the climacteric, is the time in women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently, and they are no longer able to bear children. Menopause typically occurs between 49 and 52 years of age. Medical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any menstrual bleeding for a year. It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have ovaries, menopause may be considered to have occurred at the time of the surgery or when their hormone levels fell. Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms typically occur earlier, at an average of 45 years of age.</p>
<p>Technically menopause refers to the time in your life when you've not had a period for 12 months. Many unpleasant symptoms can present themselves at this time - and unfortunately some of these are ongoing. This is because, as we age, there&rsquo;s a naturally occurring decline in hormones such as oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone. When these are out of kilter we can experience all sorts of distressing consequences.</p>
<p>Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her period stops. It usually occurs naturally, most often after age 45. Menopause happens because the woman's ovaries stop producing the hormones estrogen and progesterone. A woman has reached menopause when she has not had a period for one year. Changes and symptoms can start several years earlier. They include.</p>
<p>Menopause occurs when a woman stops ovulating and her monthly period (menstruation) ceases. Most women reach menopause between the ages of 45 and 55, with the average age being around 51. However, about one per cent of women experience menopause before the age of 40 years. This is known as premature menopause. Menopause between 41 and 45 years of age is called early menopause.</p>
<p>Menopause is not a disease, but rather the point in a woman's life at which she is no longer fertile , and menstrual periods have ceased. During this time, ovulation stops and estrogen hormones drop. Menopause can be accompanied by physical symptoms in some women, like hot flashes or night sweats. Menopause is the time point at which a woman has not had a menstrual period for 12 months. Perimenopause is the time leading up to menopause, and the symptoms of the transition can take two to ten years. Menopause can be seen as a positive beginning of a new phase of life, with opportunities to take preventive action against major health risks.</p>
<p>During menopause, all women undergo a sudden and dramatic drop in female hormones. However, the symptoms that women experience during menopause vary greatly depending on the individual. For some women, the symptoms are relatively light, while for others they are severe enough to interfere with daily life. Even the severest symptoms will gradually subside as a woman's body adjusts to a lack of the female hormone estrogen.</p>
<p>Some 95% had never spoken to the employer about what they were experiencing and 86% had not raised the issue with their gp. Some 73% of 45 to 54-year-old women said menopause symptoms &ndash; which can include chronic insomnia, night sweats, anxiety and racing thoughts &ndash; had affected their sleep recently, with 32% of over-40s getting only an average of six hours of sleep a night and one in 10 over-55s waking up at least five times a night, the onepoll survey commissioned by wellness brand cbii found.</p>
<p>How much do you really know about the symptoms of menopause? hot flushes and night sweats are among the more commonly recognised side effects of this midlife hormonal shift, yet there are plenty of other far less familiar related symptoms. Some more life-affecting than others, but because so many women still don&rsquo;t feel able to open up, many of us don&rsquo;t even realise the physical and emotional symptoms we&rsquo;re experiencing are hormone-related.</p>
<p>Most of us know the classic signs, such as flushes, sweats and insomnia, but the menopause can also bring a range of less familiar, unexpected problems. 21/09/2020 menopausal women are more prone to bppv - when the world appears to be spinning. Close.</p>
<h3 id="7">Natural Menopause Symptom Relief</h3>
<p>Getty images for many women, menopause comes as a relief: an end to pregnancy worries and monthly cramps, a farewell to bloodstained panties and premenstrual mood swings. Though menopause signals the opening of a historically uncelebrated chapter in a woman&rsquo;s journey, lots of women are thrilled to cross its threshold. Others loathe the passage. For them it&rsquo;s a journey often punctuated by hot flashes, insomnia and, in numerous cases, sexual dysfunction &mdash; symptoms that for some can continue for 15 years or longer. These episodes can make women in their 50s and 60s feel uncomfortable, demoralized and sometimes seriously ill.</p>
<p>Menopause is a natural event in the life of all women. However, each woman will experience their own combination of symptoms. Many women will experience few or mild symptoms, but others can have severe effects both physically and emotionally impacting on their work and home life. It&rsquo;s important to remember that these effects are not an indication of your general health, but part of the process of your body changing.</p>
<p>Menopause occurs when you have not had a menstrual&nbsp;period for 12 months. Menopause is a natural part of life&nbsp;occurring at around age 51 years but can also happen&nbsp;for other reasons including after: surgery to remove ovaries (oophorectomy) and/or&nbsp;your womb/uterus (hysterectomy) radiotherapy to your pelvis. At menopause, you stop producing oestrogen (the main&nbsp;sex hormone in women) and this can lead to menopausal&nbsp;symptoms. Oestrogen levels can vary in the time leading up&nbsp;to the final menstrual period (called the perimenopause).</p>
<p>Menopause happens naturally to women at the end of their childbearing years, usually as they approach mid-life, when they stop ovulating and their bodies stop preparing for the possibility of bearing a child. In the united states, the average age for menopause is 51 for non-smokers and 49 for smokers, with a typical age range somewhere between 47 and 55 years. Some women experience menopause sooner &mdash; before age 45 is considered early menopause, and before age 40 is considered premature menopause. Women who undergo hysterectomy surgery may experience menopause sooner than they would have naturally. Regardless, any woman who is approaching the middle of life can expect hormonal changes to kick in soon and for the menopause process to start. If symptoms are especially difficult or hard to handle, it can be helpful to seek support from health care professionals.</p>
<p>We all need a good night&rsquo;s sleep and perimenopause has been known to disrupt natural sleeping patterns, robbing women of the deep restorative sleep they need to face the day. It can leave you feeling exhausted and exacerbates the other symptoms of perimenopause.</p>
<h3 id="8">Symptoms of the menopause</h3>
<p>Menopause is a normal life event for women and so it is not an illness or a medical condition (apart from a few exceptions e. G. Autoimmune poi, or following cancer treatment). This means that the symptoms of the menopause are too often under recognised, undervalued and not taken seriously. The psychological symptoms associated with the menopause such as loss of self-confidence, low self-esteem, anxiety and depressive symptoms are the ones that often affect women the most.</p>
<p>Treatments for genitourinary syndrome of menopause include both nonhormone and hormone options. Many women start by using over-the-counter vaginal lubricants or moisturizers, which contain no hormones. Lubricants are generally used to help with sex, while moisturizers can be used at all times to help with general feelings of dryness. Continued sexual activity can also help with vaginal symptoms.</p>
<p>In the us, menopause occurs at an average age of 52. Symptoms of menopause tend to be maximal during the few years before and the year after menopause (during perimenopause), except for symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy, which may worsen over time. Up to 20% of bone density loss occurs during the first 5 years after menopause, followed by age-related rate of bone loss similar to that in men.</p>
<p>Dr tara swart, neuroscientist and author many women don't know that anxiety can be the first and only sign of perimenopuase, before any physical symptoms. Depression can also occur, but it's important to understand that this is normal and temporary. After menopause, some women report memory loss, especially verbal recall, which can prompt misplaced fears of early dementia. These symptoms generally improve with oestrogen replacement, while a healthy diet, gentle aerobic exercise and reducing alcohol consumption all help.</p>
<p>Perimenopause , sometimes referred to as menopausal transition, starts when a woman begins experiencing changes in her menstrual cycle (for example, longer or shorter cycles), as well as&nbsp;symptoms related to a decline in estrogen levels&mdash;most notably hot flashes. The majority of women enter perimenopause sometime in their 40s , with the average age being 47. perimenopause then ends when a woman has not had a menstrual period for 12 consecutive months;&nbsp;this is termed menopause.</p>
<p>Many women experience a variety of symptoms as a result of the hormonal changes associated with the transition to menopause. Around the time of menopause, women often lose bone density , and their blood cholesterol levels may worsen, increasing their risk of heart disease. Examples of these include vaginal dryness, pain during sex and loss of interest in sex, weight gain, and mood swings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to use the right type of estrogen for you. If you&rsquo;re experiencing vaginal or menopause-related urinary tract issues, a topical estrogen applied directly to the vagina could be the best choice. If you&rsquo;re experiencing a variety of symptoms or prefer to not use a cream, you may decide to go with an oral estrogen.</p>
<p>Menopause, permanent cessation of menstruation that results from the loss of ovarian function and therefore represents the end of a woman&rsquo;s reproductive life. At the time of menopause the ovaries contain very few follicles; they have decreased in size, and they consist mostly of atretic (shrunken) follicles, some interstitial cells, and fibrous tissue. Estrogen production decreases by 80 percent or more, and this along with the loss of follicles results in marked increases in the secretion of luteinizing hormone (lh) and follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh). Menstrual periods may cease abruptly or may be irregular for a year or so before ceasing. In a similar fashion, menopausal symptoms may occur abruptly or gradually. While menopausal symptoms may begin when the woman is still menstruating, they are more likely to begin after menstruation ceases.</p>
<p>When it comes to the menopause , we certainly won&rsquo;t all experience it equally. The reality is that for every woman who sails through unscathed, there'll be four others who find themselves in an unfamiliar world of hot flushes, aching joints, disturbed sleep, foggy brain and mood swings. One in four women say symptoms are severe enough to affect their quality of life &ndash; and for some, it can persist for years.</p>
<p>During perimenopause you might have symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, joint and muscle pain, vaginal dryness, mood changes and a lack of interest in sex. Menopause affects every woman differently. You may have no symptoms at all, or they might be brief and short&acirc;&euro;&lsquo;lived. For some women they are severe and distressing.</p>
<p>Lowered mood if you have menopause as a result of surgery or menopause as a result of chemotherapy treatment, you might find your symptoms are more severe. Seek help from your doctor if you are concerned about your physical or emotional symptoms.</p>
<p>Some breast cancer treatments cause low levels of sex hormones that lead to an early menopause or menopausal symptoms. Find out how to manage the effects. Hormone therapy&nbsp;can cause menopausal symptoms even in women whose periods stopped some years before being diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>
<p>In the united states more than 1. 3 million women are expected to reach menopause every year. The transition to menopause, or perimenopause, represents the passage from reproductive to non-reproductive life. During the perimenopause, women experience irregular menstrual cycles (e. G. , shortened or longer cycles), which reflect the large fluctuation of ovarian hormone secretion during this time. In addition, they may experience vasomotor symptoms, changes in sleep patterns, and psychological symptoms.</p>
<p>Key messages women usually go through the menopause in their 40s or 50s the fall in oestrogen levels during the menopause can cause a variety of symptoms that usually last for about 4 years after the menopause, the long-term effects of lower oestrogen levels increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (i. E. Heart disease and strokes) and osteoporosis (thinning of the bones which increases the risk of breakage).</p>

<p>The menopause can last as long as 12 years, and is likely to affect women from certain groups for longer than others, a major new study has concluded. Women suffer from hot flushes and other symptoms, such as night sweats, for an average of around seven years, according to the us research. But, for some, the symptoms lasted up to 11. 8 years, far longer than originally thought. Researchers discovered that the earlier women started experiencing menopausal symptoms &ndash; some while they were still menstruating &ndash; the longer they lasted.</p>
<h3 id="9">Treatments for menopausal symptoms</h3>
<p>Estrogen is a highly effective treatment for menopausal vasomotor symptoms. For women with vasomotor symptoms who cannot take estrogen, however, moderately effective alternative treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris), and gabapentin. A meta-analysis of seven clinical trials of the ssri and snri antidepressants and three trials of gabapentin provided evidence of the efficacy of these agents for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. 5 in the meta-analysis, placebo treatment resulted in an average 24% reduction in reported vasomotor symptoms. The active treatments resulted in significantly greater reductions in vasomotor symptoms, compared with placebo. Venlafaxine 75 mg daily resulted in a 33% greater reduction in vasomotor symptoms than placebo. Gabapentin 900 mg to 2500 mg daily resulted in a 35% to 38% greater reduction in hot flashes than placebo. Paroxetine (25 mg daily), fluoxetine (20 mg daily), and sertraline (50 mg daily) also were effective. Desvenlafaxine at a dose of 100 mg daily recently has been reported to be effective for the treatment of hot flashes. 6.</p>
